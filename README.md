# 🌱 NomaApp AI

**NomaApp AI** is an AI-powered mobile application built to help smallholder farmers in Africa detect crop diseases and pest infestations in real time. By using machine learning and computer vision, the app empowers farmers with fast, accessible, and accurate crop diagnostics — even in remote, low-connectivity areas.

- 📷 Instant image-based diagnosis of plant diseases and pests
- 🌽 Tailored treatment advice for local crops
- 🌐 Offline functionality for rural areas with poor internet access
- 🔄 Continuous improvement using farmer-submitted images and feedback
